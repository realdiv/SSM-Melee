Some random shit dude!

First off, remember that in the future we want an in-game testing mode. This mode would allow you to change all
game values to whatever the fuck you want(within the int/double limits of course)! Most of the values can be
changed at a per person level. Some of the more delicate values will be locked (-Locked) to everyone besides Devs.

-Formulas could be edited using books

It's usable in both GUI and command form. To open up the GUI run the command /debugsmash. Once the command has
been run, you'll receive a Golden Apple at the end of your inventory, when that Golden Apple is right-clicked,
it'll open up the GUI and you're free to start changing shit.


 Some examples of the values you could change are:

      -Kit Things - Has nothing to do with values, but this will allow you to change which abilities are on which class
                  and which kit you're currently using. Nothing special, but it's a necessity.

      -Stock values - Whether it be what you start off with or how many you have in the game.

      -Damage values - Whether it be ability damage, melee damage or even entity damage!

      -Knockback values - Not to be confused with Knockback Multiplier, this will allow you to change the knockback of
                          melee, abilities or again, entities.

      -Knockback Multiplier - This will allow you to change the knockback multiplier completely, and that includes the
                              formula for the multiplier itself (assuming health and knockback are both in this).. be
                              careful with that. This also allows you to change someone's multiplier at any given
                              time. This will have to be specially coded though, since it would likely reset if health
                              were a feature.

                              -Locked

      -Kit Statistics - Self-explanatory, but, for the memes - that includes regen(If it's a feature), armor, knockback
                        and damage.

      -Vector values - Whether that be your double jump, abilities or even your walking speed

      -Radius values - Mostly applies to abilities, but this will allow you to change the radius of a bunch of shit

      -Cooldowns - Allows you to change cooldowns of abilities, it allows you to set it in any unit of time, whether
                   that be ticks, seconds, minutes, hours, etc.

      -Rebound Physics - This one isn't gonna be fun.. this will allow you to change the formula for rebound physics.
                         This one in particular is... Well, messy. I wouldn't recommend fucking with this one.

                         -Locked

      -Void Border - This allows you to change the border area.

Nigger Dabber's "impossible" ideas:

-the jew turns into a 3D human looking nigger with a nigger
bottle on its hand and then the map turns into a gas chamber
and the nigger gas starts gassing all the jews and then the
nigger runs but the door closes and the floor turns into nigger
spikes and the nigger flies away in a rocket ship into mars and
then he meets the nigger aliens that want to kill him so he goes
to jupiter and there he meets all the whores that want to suck
his dick so he flies to pluto and then he freezes into a frozen
nigger and dies

-Make fire have a shocking strikes damage effect, each fake hit will +1 your knockback
